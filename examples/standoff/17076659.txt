Glutamate-stimulated ATP release from spinal cord astrocytes is potentiated by substance P.
ATP has recently emerged as a key molecule mediating pathological pain. The aim of this study was to examine whether spinal cord astrocytes could be a source of ATP in response to the nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate and substance P. Glutamate stimulated ATP release from these astrocytes and this release was greatly potentiated by substance P, even though substance P alone did not elicit ATP release. Substance P also potentiated glutamate-induced inward currents, but did not cause such currents alone. When glutamate was applied alone it acted exclusively through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionate receptors to stimulate Ca(2+) influx-dependent ATP release. However, when substance P was co-applied with glutamate, ATP release could be elicited by activation of NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Activation of neurokinin receptor subtypes, protein kinase C and phospholipases A(2), C and D were needed for substance P to bring about its effects. These results suggest that astrocytes may be a major source of ATP in the spinal cord on activation of nerve fibres that release substance P and glutamate.
